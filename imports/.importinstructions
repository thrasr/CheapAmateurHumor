In order to import a set there are two files that you are looking for.

First is the JSON file, and this is mandatory.  The file will be named SETNAME.json.

Second is the icon file, and this is optional.  The file will be named SETNAMEicon.png

Place the file(s) into this directory and then navigate to the import functionality of whichever program you're using.
