The convertPDF.py script attempts to take one of these official PDFs and convert the squares into standard size cards.  A set will be created from these squares.  Be aware that the script will convert any rules or introduction sections into cards as well, so be aware that a user should sift through the cards afterwards to remove these.  These functionality may be removed in favor of text based set lists.

Eventual usage will be as follows:

    python convertPDF.py nameofPDF.pdf "Set Name Here"
